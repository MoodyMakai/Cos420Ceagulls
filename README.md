Problem Statements:
- [ ] Many people enjoy retro classic games: pacman, snake, donkey kong, e.t.c. Nowadays, there have been several attempts to bring games like this to the modern era, such as Tetris 99. Modernized versions of Snake, however, have been limited to simple flash games with few new features, if any. Snake needs to be brought to the modern era with new features and customization for users. 

Build Intstructions:
- [ ] Pull the repo
- [ ] In your IDE, type "npm run dev"



Here is a good example of snake in js
