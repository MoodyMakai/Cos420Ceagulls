Problem Statements:
- [ ] Many people are looking for a way to stay entertained and are unable to find something that suits them. For example, someone may go looking for a game to play on steam, and they are unable to find a game that pique's their interest. Some game storefront's offer a random game button, such as Steam's "Surprise Me!" button, but this may result in a user just hitting the button until they get lucky. Within the constraints of web development using react and javascript, how can we create a game that is universally enjoyable?


- [ ] People look for certain websites or apps that solve a certain problem and are unable to find a good solution.
