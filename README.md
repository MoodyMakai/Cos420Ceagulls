Problem Statements:
- [ ] Many people are looking for a way to stay entertained and are unable to find something that suits them. For example, someone may go looking for a game to play on steam, and they are unable to find a game that piques their interest. Some game storefront's offer a random game button, such as Steam's "Surprise Me!" button, but this may result in a user just hitting the button until they get lucky. Just gambling with luck until you find a game you enjoy is similar to the original issue. Within the constraints of web development using react and javascript, how can we create a game that is universally enjoyable?


- [ ] People look for certain websites or apps that solve a certain problem and are unable to find a good solution. The internet is full of an uncountable amount of websites and apps that are trying to solve a problem. However, when looking for a specific solution to your problem, sometimes you may be unable to find the right solution for you. Using Google can be good if the website that solves your problem exists, but what if it doesn't? So, how can we create a website or app that solves a problem that is currently not well addressed on Google?
